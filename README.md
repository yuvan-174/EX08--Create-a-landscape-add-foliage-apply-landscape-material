# EX08--Create-a-landscape-add-foliage-apply-landscape-material

## Aim
To create a landscape in Unreal Engine, apply a custom landscape material, and add foliage for realistic environment generation.

## Procedure

1. *Create a New Landscape:*
   - Open your Unreal Engine project.
   - Go to the *Modes Panel* and select *Landscape*.
   - Set the desired section size, number of components, and overall resolution.
   - Click *Create* to generate the landscape.

2. *Apply a Landscape Material:*
   - In the *Content Browser, create a new **Material* and name it M_Landscape.
   - Open the material and:
     - Use *Landscape Layer Blend* to blend textures (e.g., grass, rock, dirt).
     - Connect appropriate texture samplers to different layers.
     - Output the final blend to the *Base Color, **Normal, and optionally **Roughness* inputs.
   - Save the material.
   - Select the landscape in the scene, go to the *Details Panel*, and assign M_Landscape to the *Landscape Material* slot.

3. *Add Foliage:*
   - Go to the *Foliage Mode* from the *Select Mode dropdown*.
   - In the *Foliage Panel, click the **+* icon to add Static Meshes (e.g., trees, grass, bushes).
   - Adjust settings like *Density, **Scale, and **Randomness*.
   - Use the brush tool to paint foliage onto the landscape.

## Result
A landscape was successfully created and enhanced with:
- A layered, textured material using M_Landscape.
- Static mesh foliage such as trees and grass for realism.
This setup provides a foundation for open-world levels, terrain-based gameplay, or environmental simulations in Unreal Engine.
